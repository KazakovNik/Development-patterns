Fundamental design patterns comprise the basic design patterns that underlie most software design approaches. Their purpose is to facilitate the development of robust and readable solutions by enabling effective management of the system's structure and behavior.
- Delegation Pattern is a pattern in which an object delegates the execution of an operation to another object responsible for it.
- Functional Design is an approach to software creation focused on treating functions as primary entities.
- Immutable Interface is a pattern that assumes the use of an immutable API, where the object's state does not change after its initialization.
- Interface is a pattern that defines a contract for class methods, guaranteeing uniform interaction between classes regardless of their internal implementation.
- Marker Interface is a special type of interface used exclusively for marking classes or objects with specific properties.
- Property Container is a way to store a set of object attributes separately from the object itself.
- Event Channel is a mechanism for passing messages within the system via event channels.

Creational design patterns are designed to effectively manage the process of object creation. These patterns address the problem of how to create objects correctly and flexibly, especially in situations where encapsulating implementation details, reducing module coupling, and increasing code reuse are important.
- Abstract Factory defines an interface for creating families of related or interdependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- Builder decouples the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same process to build different representations.
- Factory Method provides a method for creating objects that can be overridden by subclasses.
- Lazy Initialization allows object creation to be deferred until it is first accessed.
- Multiton ensures that a limited number of class instances exist.
- Object Pool creates a pool of ready-to-use objects, preventing memory over-allocation and speeding up program execution by reusing the same objects.
- Prototype clones an existing object to create a new instance.
- Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) ensures automatic resource release.
- Singleton guarantees the existence of exactly one instance of a class and provides a global access point to this instance.
